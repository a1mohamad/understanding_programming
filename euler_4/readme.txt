The problem is we wanna find the largest palindrome made from the product 
of two 3-digit numbers.
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 121, 9009).
We need to find the largest palindromic number that can be formed by multiplying 
two three-digit numbers (100-999).
Example:
91
×
99
=
9009
91×99=9009 (Palindrome ✅)
123
×
456
=
56088
123×456=56088 (Not a palindrome ❌)
