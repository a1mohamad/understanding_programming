In this exercise, We want to create a python code for finding pin code of
a user with this conditions:
1.I know pin code have 5 digits.
2.Summation of digit 3 and digit five are 14.
3.Digit one of pin is one less than two times of digit two.
4.Digit four is one more than digit two.
5.Summation of digit 2 and digit three are 10.
6.Summation of all digits of pin is 30.

We can find pin code in 2 ways:
I. With writing functions to compute over a loop
II. With creating a 5 equations and a matrix and calculate with NumPy

All two ways are uploaded.
