In this project, we want to see if the probability of getting different 
numbers on a dice is really equal!

In this exercise, you need to perform a simple simulation of the dice 
rolling space and then plot the results with matplotlib.

Step 1) Using the random library, generate a large number of numbers 
between 1 and 6 (say 10,000 times!) and store them in a list.

Hint: First, generate a 6-member list where all members are 0. Each 
index represents a number on the dice.

Step 2) Using the matplotlib library, print the results and draw conclusions.
